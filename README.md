>How to Install Eclipse on Windows
Step 0: Install JDK

To use Eclipse for Java programming, you need to first install Java Development Kit (JDK). Read "How to Install JDK for Windows".
Step 1: Download

Download Eclipse from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads. Under "Get Eclipse IDE 2029-12" ⇒ Click the link "Download Packages" (instead of pushing the button "Download x86_64"). For beginners, choose the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" and "Windows x86_64" (e.g., "eclipse-java-2020-12-R-win32-x86_64.zip" - about 201MB) ⇒ Download.
Step 2: Unzip

To install Eclipse, simply unzip the downloaded file into a directory of your choice (e.g., "c:\myProject").

I prefer the zip version, because there is no need to run any installer. Moreover, you can simply delete the entire Eclipse directory when it is no longer needed (without running any un-installer). You are free to move or rename the directory. You can install (unzip) multiple copies of Eclipse in the same machine.

* Now open GroceryStoreApplication.java file and then run as a java appliaction. This will run the backend application by using the provided tomcat server on the given port.


> For Installing Angular on your Machine, there are 2 prerequisites:

    *Node.js
    *npm Package Manager

# Node.js

First you need to have Node.js installed as Angular require current, active LTS or maintenance LTS version of Node.js

Download and Install Node.js version suitable for your machine’s operating system.
Npm Package Manager

Angular, Angular CLI and Angular applications are dependent on npm packages. By installing Node.js, you have automatically installed the npm Package manager which will be the base for installing angular in your system. To check the presence of npm client and Angular version check of npm client, run this command:

*npm -v

# Installing Angular CLI

    * Open Terminal/Command Prompt
    * To install Angular CLI, run the below command:

 npm install -g @angular/cli
 
 
 # To create a workspace:

    Navigate to the desired directory where you want to create your workspace using cd command in the Terminal/Command prompt
    Then in the directory write this command on your terminal and provide the name of the app which you want to create. In my case I have mentioned DataFlair:

   *Ng new YourAppName


By this command the Angular CLI installs all the necessary dependencies and npm packages. This creates a Welcome app in the workspace which can be run instantly.
This process of workspace creation may take time depending upon your internet connection speed as Angular CLI has to download necessary packages.
After the commands executes successfully, you are ready to run the application.


* Here, run the following command:

     ng serve –open


The serve commands launches the server. Server is responsible for keeping an eye on your file. It is also responsible for updating and rebuilding the file according to the changes you make in the source code 

The –open option launches your application in the default browser of your machine
If the browser doesn’t start automatically then you can always type this address in your browser to open the application window: http://localhost:4200/
If the process gets completed successfully, your browser window will open


## Usage
> This Project is used to develop a simple grocery store webapplication that includes basic Resistration , Login, Edit, Delete a customer, View product, Add to Cart and Buy products.
> Admin can view the products ordered by the customer and can view their comments and can update the products.
